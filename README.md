# archeio
Kind of an archive for my documents, but not only that.

# goals
- A personally owned data center to archive my documents (with backups on multiple locations)
- A cluster of servers, to serve documents that I might want to access via the internet (both public and private, but different)
- It's like a personal AWS, created for my own
